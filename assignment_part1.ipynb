    "# Assignment (part 1): classification of cell morphological changes with LeNet\n",
    "_by Phil Harrison (February 2021), verified by David Holmberg (2023)_\n",
    "#### Inspiration\n",
    "This step by step exercise was inspired by Andrew Ng's **Deep learning** Coursera specialization (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) . This assignment will take you through a machine learning workflow which includes reading datasets, creating and compiling models, training models on datasets, and predicting on the validation sets (for model comparisons). Much of the experience you accumualted during the labs from yesterday and the day before will come in useful here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets\n",
    "The specific dataset we will use is a subset of the bbbc021v1 MoA dataset (http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/9/6/1913) available from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2083). We chose to only use a subset of this data (based on only the six main MoAs) in order that the models we will fit below would not take too long to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance\n",
    "After you've completed this assignment you will know how to develop and utilize advanced machine learning models (in this case convlutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to high content cell images). Traditional approaches for classyfing such biological cell-images involve complex workflows, with many steps requiring manual implementation. The more modern neural network approach (made possible through the better hardware available today, most notably via GPUs) can perform equally well and often better than the traditional approaches. What's more these CNNs, based merely on the pixel-intensities of the images, require significantly less domain expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note 1\n",
    "You need to complete 2 out of the four assigments be graded G. Complete all four to bre graded VG. Parts 1 and 2 are made to be important, yet simple. Part 3 and 4 are harder, but teach important lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note 2\n",
    "For the assignment we will split the data into a training and validation set and will only optimize our performance on the validation set. Although from the work with the oral cancer data you saw that it is genrally best to keep out a test set on which to make a final evaluation of your chosen model."

The final line of your code should be a dense layer with a softmax activation. Once you have your code ready run the cell and see if your model summary matches ours (see below). Note, the stride of 2 for the first convolutional layer is something you should define within the braces of `layers.Conv2D(...)` along with the other arguments you are now used to. You can press `STIFT+TAB` from inside the braces to see the aruments that can be passed. Also pay attention to how the dimensions above change from one part of the model to the next - with the max pooling we don't always use the defualt pool size of `(2, 2)`. To compensate for over-fitting add a dropout layer prior to your prediction layer with a dropout rate of `0.2`. Name your model `LeNet`."
