    "# Artificial neural networks for QSAR\n",
    "_by Phil Harrison (February 2021)_\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "For this exercise we will use the same dataset of aqueous solubility of 1142 diverse chemical compounds as you previously explored during the QSAR lab last week. However, here we will only use the PhysChem descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modelling comparisons\n",
    "1. Compare the results of linear regression to those of a simple neural network with no hidden layers and no non-linear activation functions\n",
    "2. Compare the results of a a random forest regressor, a support vector regressor, and a neural network with two hidden layers (with non-linear activations) and dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aims\n",
    "* to see the link between neural networks and linear regression\n",
    "* to learn the basics of how to define, compile, fit and evaluate neural networks via TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "We will be using the open-source machine learning framework TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org) and Keras (https://keras.io) for our neural networks. TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team and is today one of the most widely used machine learning frameworks in research and industry and Keras was/is the most popular higher-level API that runs atop TensorFlow. However, last year TensorFlow 2 was released. In TensorFow 2 (which we will use for all our neural network work) Keras is now fully integrated. This means that we get all the benefits of TensorFlow with a much easier (Keras-type) way to define and train models than was previously possible with TensorFlow 1."
