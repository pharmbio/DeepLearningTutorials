    "# Artificial neural networks (ANNs) for image data\n",
    "_by Phil Harrison (February 2021)_\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "For this exercise we will use the MNIST dataset: greyscale images (28 x 28 pixels) of hand-written digits that we wish to classify into their corresponding ten categories (0 to 9). Note we now have a classification problem, as opposed to the QSAR regression problem from part 1 of today's lab. The MNIST dataset is a classical benchmark dataset in machine learning, a first port of call for testing new neural network architectures. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is like the 'Hello world' for neural networks. The images were collected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST in MNIST) in the 1980s. The images were centred and scaled to fit into the 28 x 28 pixel crops.\n",

    "    <center>Figure 1. Example MNIST images (figure from Wikipedia).</center>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modelling approach\n",
    "Here we will flatten the 28 x 28 pixel images into vectors of size 785 (= 28*28) and try to solve the classification problem with ANNs. For such a simple task with such small size images this will work quite well. As we move to larger images, with more image channels (such as red, green and blue (RGB) as in most colour images), such flattening and analysis with plain (vanilla) neural networks will not work. How to more adequately deal with more complex image data and classification problems will be the focus of the lectures and labs during the rest of this week. One point to note with respect to this flattening of the data is that we lose spatial information (think about it, each pixel in an image tends to be correlated with the pixels to the left, right, above and below it). How might we accomodate for this? Well, an extremely good approach is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs, the focus of the lecture and lab tomorrow and the assignment you will do). For this lab we will overlook this complication and move forward with a flattened representation of the image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### References\n",
    "This section of the lab borrows/steals heavily from material from the book written by Francois Chollet (the invenor of Keras!; https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff). This book is great! I highly recommed it. Some ideas I also stole from the Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-tensorflow-2/), which was also quite good... Whilst I'm at it, for those who are interested, I highly recommend checking out Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/) and Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/), two online platforms where you can learn much more about AI, machine learning and deep learning.

    "\"The core building block of neural networks is the \"layer\", a data-processing module which you can conceive as a \"filter\" for data. Some data comes in, and comes out in a more useful form. Precisely, layers extract _representations_ out of the data fed into them -- hopefully representations that are more meaningful for the problem at hand. Most of deep learning really consists of chaining together simple layers which will implement a form of progressive \"data distillation\". A deep learning model is like a sieve for data processing, made of a succession of increasingly refined data filters -- the \"layers\".\"\n",

It is often difficult in advance to say how wide and deep neural network architectures should be for a given dataset and hence some exploration, some trial and error, is often required. You can also change the number of epochs to train for if it looks like your validation loss still wants to go down."

Afterall, flattening the images as we did looks at each pixel in isolation. If we can take the correlated nature of image pixels into account we can do much better. The best way of doing this is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the focus of the rest of this week. With CNNs on the MNIST data we can easily get greater than 99% accuracy on the MNIST test images!"
